ansible-dev-templates
=====================

Development templates for ansible.  It should be integrated with ansible-sdk so that we have an imperative method 
to create roles and playbooks, but that hasn't been done yet.

localenv: Supporting code necessary to help provide a Vagrant environment for local development

role: Files necessary for a role, taken pretty much exactly from `ansible-galaxy init`
